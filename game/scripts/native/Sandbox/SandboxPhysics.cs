/// Where the sandbox verbs leave things, worked out with Jolt's shape queries against the room's real colliders at the
/// moment the command arrives, so a result is decided before its receipt is written and replays exactly.
/// - The query shape is the thing's box (its asset dimensions at its scale and rotation, pivot at the bottom centre),
///   half a millimetre narrower on each side so things set flush against each other are not taken for overlapping.
/// - Dropping and placing start the thing just above where it goes and sweep it straight down onto the first support;
///   the rest height is then snapped to that support's surface by rays, so stacks sit exactly on their supports.
/// - A push slides the thing a centimetre at a time a millimetre above its support, against the world and both avatars:
///   it stops early at an obstacle, climbs a ledge up to a quarter of its own height (at most 1 cm, so a book rides over
///   a rug's edge), settles after every step and falls when it leaves its support. A push that leaves it hanging with
///   its centre over nothing carries on until it tips off, at most half its diagonal further.
/// - A carried thing is put down along a path from over its holder's head (up at the holder if the spot is higher, then
///   across, then down onto the spot), probed along the thing's centre line against the world: a wall between holder and
///   spot stops it, however thin. (A thing carried overhead may clip a wall beside its holder; that alone does not.)
/// - Things rest only on the room's shell and objects. A creation is an obstacle but never a support (a thing on one
///   would float once the creation went), so a verb that would leave a thing on a creation is refused.
/// Things stay upright: there is no tipping over, rolling or sliding once at rest.
