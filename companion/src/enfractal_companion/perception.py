"""Line of sight for the mock host: what an avatar can perceive right now.

The founder's rule (6 October 2026): a companion perceives anything within line of sight of its
avatar. The mock tests it geometrically against the room manifest:

- the eye is the avatar's position raised to its eye height (companion 0.205 m, player 0.087 m);
- each candidate entity is sampled at 15 points on its bounds: the centre, the eight corners and the
  six face centres, each pulled 1 cm (or a quarter of the size, whichever is smaller) inside the box;
- a sample is seen when the segment from the eye to it crosses no occluder: the room's shell parts
  (floor, walls, ceiling, as their polygons' boxes) and every object and creation box, except the
  entity itself and any box that contains the eye;
- the entity is perceived when at least one sample is seen.

Avatars and effects never occlude. Everything here is axis-aligned boxes, which is what the mock
knows about shapes; the kernel host in Run 2 replaces it with physics ray casts against the real
colliders. The rule, not this geometry, is the contract.
