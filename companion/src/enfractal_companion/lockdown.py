"""Process lockdown for the companion MCP server: defence in depth, not an operating-system sandbox.

Having no file, shell or URL tools is the boundary. This is a second layer, for the case where the
server's own code or a dependency is tricked by input into calling something it should not. Once
the server has loaded the contracts and knows where the session file is, it

1. clears its own environment down to what Windows sockets need, so no inherited developer
   secret (API keys, tokens, cloud credentials) exists in the process to leak;
2. installs a Python audit hook (PEP 578) that refuses, for the rest of the process's life, these
   audited standard-library routes to the outside world:
   - `open` for writing anything, and for reading anything except the session file, the Python
     installation (with its site-packages), the package and the contracts; listing directories
     outside those; deleting, renaming, copying, linking, creating directories, changing modes;
   - starting or signalling processes (subprocess, os.system, exec, spawn, startfile, kill);
   - every audited `_winapi` call (CreateFile, CreateProcess, OpenProcess, TerminateProcess, pipes,
     junctions, file mappings) and every audited `ctypes` call (loading a library, calling a
     foreign function);
   - socket connects, binds and sends to anything but a loopback IP literal (127.0.0.0/8, ::1),
     name lookups of anything but such a literal ("localhost" included: no name is resolved), and
     URL fetching, the browser, the registry, sqlite and environment changes;
3. wraps the Windows event loop's connect, sendto and named-pipe connect, which go through
   `_overlapped` without an audit event, so asyncio cannot reach a non-loopback address or a named
   pipe either.

What it does not do, and the tests in companion/tests/test_lockdown.py pin both lists:
- An audit hook sees only what Python audits. Calls with no audit event are not covered: os.stat
  and os.path.exists still tell whether a path exists anywhere. Native extension modules already
  loaded in the process are not covered either: on Windows the MCP SDK's stdio transport imports
  pywin32 (win32api, win32job), whose functions raise no audit events.
- Paths are compared as text after normalising case and '..'. A symbolic link or junction that
  already exists inside an allowed folder is followed. Nothing in the process can create one.
- It cannot be undone, but code running in the process with the intent to escape (rather than
  being tricked into one call) can get around it; that is outside what an audit hook can stop.
- The process still runs with the player's full account rights. The MCP client should launch the
  server as the player's ordinary account with no extra privileges; an operating-system sandbox
  (a restricted token, an AppContainer, a separate account) is the step that would make this a
  containment boundary (docs/companion/SECURITY.md).
