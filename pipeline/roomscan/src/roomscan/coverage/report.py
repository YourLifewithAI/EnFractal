"""The coverage report for the founder (HTML and Markdown) and the full record (coverage.json).

Plain language first: what to photograph next, then the map, then what went wrong with which
photos, then how sure the numbers are. Technical details sit at the end. The HTML embeds its
images so the one file can be opened anywhere on this machine; it stays under ``captures/``,
which Git ignores, because it shows the real room.
