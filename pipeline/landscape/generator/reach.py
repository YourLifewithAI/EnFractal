"""Reach by foot and by climb: where a body of each band gets, proved by the exact walk.

Feet. `checks.Walker` floods the lattice from the spawn: a node is standable when an 11 cm disc round it is dry, clear
of obstacles, inside the floor and on faces of 20 degrees or less, and every edge is sampled each centimetre for its
rise. That flood is the walk, exact; nothing here relaxes it.

Climbs. A climb is one more kind of edge. From a standable foot a face steeper than 55 degrees (the climb rule,
`climb.climb_from`) is followed up its fall line, no longer 0.6 m but as far as the tallest bar climbs, to its crest; a
standable node within a body's reach of the crest is its top. A climb's cost is the metres it rises, so it is open to a
bar of band b (`gates.cap`) when its rise is at most that. Stamina refills on standable ground, so the bar is full at
every foot: a climb is judged alone, never added to the one before.

The answer is a label per node, the lowest band from which it is reached: band 1 (the starting bar) for everything
the feet reach with no climb. Bands are flooded in turn, each from the tops the band's climbs open, so every node is
visited once. A body stretched by a knack (`gates.VARIANTS`) is the same flood with each bar's reach multiplied.

What is not modelled, so the answer is a lower bound for the body and every gate claim is made against the same
walker: slopes between 20 and 55 degrees (the body walks to 45 and scrambles above 35), shallow water (the body wades),
drops (a fall down is free of stamina), a hop onto a ledge under 6.5 cm, a tree's trunk and crown, the Gubble's help.
