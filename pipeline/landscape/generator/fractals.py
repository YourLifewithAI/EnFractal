"""Fractals and gates: the generator's part of the mechanics round (packet M4).

The island places a budget of Fractals (docs/game/MECHANICS.md section 6): real small things at crests the body can
reach by climbing, untyped by default (a heart or a band only once spent at a camp; `typed` puts the kind in the
manifest behind the rules pack's flag). The mechanics need the land to be a ladder: each rise between ledges is one band
of the stamina bar, so the player who has opened band k finds a Fractal on a ledge that needs band k, sees the next
ledge one band up, and climbs it when the next five are spent.

Built here, in two parts either side of the planting:

`plan` (before the ground is worked at 2.5 cm, on the base grid): finds places and builds the flights (routes.py):
    - the summit's corridor, cut through the tallest landmark in reach to its top, and where that is no more than the
      island's own Fractals open, a stair built on the landmark's top above its platform (the upper ledges at the top
      bands), so the summit waits for a return visit (decided 15 October),
    - ladders of gates (band 1, 2, 3, ... each one rise more), freestanding on flat meadow,
    - knack shortcuts (a higher ledge one knack at full rank opens a band sooner, the base body does not),
    - steps (one band-1 ledge: the climb a first-run player makes for a Fractal).
`finish` (on the planted island, after the exact walk): the climb-aware reach (reach.py) of the base body, one knack at
    full rank and the strongest pair; each bench's band proved (a gate that is not the band it was built as is
    reported, a bench no one reaches is dropped); the Fractals placed on benches, in hidden corners the feet reach, and
    on high ground no band reaches, spread over the island; their ids from the place; the reach report.

Ids come from the place (the first 12 hex digits of a hash of where a Fractal rests), never a count, so an id says
nothing about how many the island holds or which was placed first.
